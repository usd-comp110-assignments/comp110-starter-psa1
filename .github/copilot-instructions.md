# Requirements

- Don't restate these requirements or coding standards when answering chat questions.

# Coding Standards
- No loops should be used (e.g., while, for, or recursion).
- No functions should be defined.
- No conditionals should be used (e.g., if, elif, else).
- The turtle write method should not be used.
- Use screen.mainloop() to keep the window open.
